This is the 3rd revision of [Delivery Droid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catglo.deliverydroid "Delivery Droid") 

The 2nd revision uses google API's that are no longer public so the address autocomplete no longer works. The 3rd revision will use [MapsForge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge "MapsForge") so as not to rely on google any more.
