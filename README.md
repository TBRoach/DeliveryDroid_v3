This is the 3rd revision of [Delivery Droid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catglo.deliverydroid "Delivery Droid") 

The 2nd revision uses google API's that are no longer public so the address autocomplete no longer works. If you don't like the latest version and want to go back to the old one its available [here](https://github.com/marchold/DeliveryDroid_v3/releases/download/OLD/147.apk) The 3rd revision uses [MapsForge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge "MapsForge") for visual maps but still relies on google for the autocomplete and gecoding functionality.

The maps file are shared in the app through the [Frostwire jlibtorrent library](https://github.com/frostwire/frostwire-jlibtorrent) The torrent file located at http://zan.ooguy.com/Maps.torrent. DeliveryDroid will not be transfering any other kind of torrents and its not intended to be used as a general purpose torrent download app.

If you want to build the project check out the [build instructions](https://github.com/marchold/DeliveryDroid_v3/blob/master/HowToBuild.md)
