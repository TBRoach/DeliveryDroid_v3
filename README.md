This is the 3rd revision of [Delivery Droid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catglo.deliverydroid "Delivery Droid") 

The 2nd revision uses google API's that are no longer public so the address autocomplete no longer works. The 3rd revision will use [MapsForge](https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge "MapsForge") so as not to rely on google as much. 

The maps file will be shared in the app through the [BT torrent library](https://github.com/atomashpolskiy/bt) The torrent file located at http://zan.ooguy.com/Maps.torrent. DeliveryDroid will not be transfering any other kind of torrents and its not intended to be used as a general purpose torrent download app.

If you want to build the project check out the [build instructions](https://github.com/marchold/DeliveryDroid_v3/blob/master/HowToBuild.md)
